He has power-leveled multiple characters to 61 for free, and he has taught me how to do grind spots on call upon asking, free of charge. The pilot has given me pointers on how to progress in Black Desert, and his advice has been great. Murphy started piloting my account when I had full Tuvala gear, and I'm now at 359 AP with full sovereign weapons. If you want to see fast progress on your account, I can't recommend this pilot enough."
